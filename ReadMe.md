'''ðŸš€ **Usage**
â”œâ”€â”€ Run **degiro_IB.py** to retrieve all trading data (stock closing, FX etc)

The Dashboard has four sections:
- A range of filters to modify the data being visualised
- Some high level KPIs
- A few different graphs
- A list of all transactiosn within the filtered range to help deep dive.
![Dashboard overview](assets/dashboard_top.png)
Only the third dropdown is a bit more complex (called **Stock details**), it allows you to visualise different aspects of your investments.
- The default "High Level". You can see four curves displayed on two y axis On the right axis you can see accumulated dividends overtime. On the left axis you can see the following:
    - How much you invested "invested"
    - A benchark of the s&p 500, I chose VT ETF
    - Actual performance "Degiro IB CHF"

'''**KPI section**, I have chosen to display four KPIs important to me:
- Income saved YTD vs last year (this is purely how much has been put aside and does not consider unrealised gains/lose)
- Restaurant YTD vs last year (As we go often to the restaurant I find it important to monitor it)
- Restaurant current month vs last month
- Dividends YTD vs last year
